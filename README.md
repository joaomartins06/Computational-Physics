# Computation-Physics
Repository with different classes build in C++ that can be used as tools to solve physics or mathematics problems. 

## IntegDeriv
-Classes `Functor` and `Myfunction` are defined to create a function object
-`IntegDeriv` is used to compute numerically different integration and derivation methods.

## Matrix Solver

-`FCMatrixAlgo` creates matrixes and performs different matrix operations and algoritghms
-`EqSolver` solves systems of equations and different problems using the previous class

## ODE Solver

-`Xvar` and `ODEpoint` are auxiliar classes to define points
-`ODEsolver` solves ordinary differential equations using different numerical methods
